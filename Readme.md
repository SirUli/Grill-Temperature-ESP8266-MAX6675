## Introduction
This repository is build using [platformio](http://platformio.org/).

## Libraries
I have included the MAX6675 Library of Adafruit as it currently does not feature the fixes of a [bug](https://github.com/adafruit/MAX6675-library/issues/9). As soon as this one is included it will be removed here.

## Thanks to
